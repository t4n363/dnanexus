Scripts in the repo:
1. generate_test_data.py
Description:
The script creates a .txt file filled with random character rows, each starting and ending with the iterative row number to check result of the first test task. The generated file is limited to a size below 500MB to reduce time for generation and indexing during development, comparing to file described in the task. For me file generaion takes ~40 minutes.
When script generate_test_data.py executed, it will prompt to provide folder. Choose folder where test data will be stored, and provide full path to it. 
2. Index 
3. Binary search
